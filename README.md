Accepted challenge from Hitesh sir

spread and rest operator
If the (â€¦) operator appear on the left-hand side in destructuring then it is a REST PARAMETER.
A Rest parameter is used to map all the remaining elements in the array that have not been mapped to the rest variable itself.
It is like gathering what is left behind.
The Rest variable must always be the last otherwise a SyntaxError is thrown.
